How to Use DisMatch 18+

For Guild Owners:
Invite the DisMatch 18+ bot to your server using the invite link.
Grant the bot the necessary permissions to function correctly.
Create a dedicated room or channel for the DisMatch 18+ bot.
Configure the channel's permissions to allow only 18+ members to access it.
Type the "/matchmaking embed" command in the channel.
Customize and display the TOS with your server's specific instructions, guidelines, and user instructions.

For Users to Begin:

Press the "Set" button to open the profile customization menu.
Fill in your profile information and the criteria of the person you wish to be matched with. Most options make an "any" allowance.
While not mandatory, consider filling in the short bio for your match to read. 
Please be careful about TOS and local server rules when choosing your words, and do not give too much information too soon.
Press the "Get" button to review your answers.
Make necessary changes by pressing the "Update" button.
Press "Match" and wait to be matched:


After Matching:

Upon matching, if the person has filled out their bio, DisMatch 18+ will connect you two via private DM, and the bio will be provided. If they did not submit a bio, the DM will say, "Say, Hi!" At this juncture, your identities remain completely anonymous.
If/when you have decided this is the right match for you, you can choose to reveal your Discord names to each other using the /reveal command in the DisMatch 18+ DM. You both must agree.
You could also remain anonymous and continue chatting with your match without revealing your Discord names. Note you will not be matched with another person during this time.
If you're not interested in your match, you can return to the DisMatch 18+ bot in the server and select "Unmatch." The system will begin looking for your next match, and you will never be matched with that person again.
You can receive up to two matches per 24-hour period. If you need a break, select "Unset" on the DisMatch 18+ bot in the server and start over when you're ready.

Reporting:

Unfortunately, interactions, even short ones, do not always end in a tidy fashion. If during your DisMatch 18+ DM conversation, there are any ToS violations, any form of abuse or harassment, the suspicion of a minor, solicitation for services, verifiable catfishing, or any other behaviors that make you feel unsafe, please use the report function to alert a member of staff with the /report command. Please be prepared to give details of the interaction and screenshots if applicable. After parties have revealed themselves and moved to their DMs, DisMatch 18+ will not get involved in disputes. However, if the conduct is especially egregious and the person's continued presence in the service poses a mental or emotional risk to others, feel free to submit a ticket for review with evidence of the interaction.

Important Notice:

DisMatch 18+ is a platform for online matchmaking and social interaction. It does not endorse the character or actions of any individual user. Users are solely responsible for their interactions and should exercise caution and common sense.
